# Philosophical meaning:

Philosophically, DreamTalk represents the extension of the ancient modality of SandTalk, popularised through Tyson Yunkapurta through his book of the same name, into the digital domain
The landscape of SandTalk is shaped by the constraint that for all symbols it needs to be feasible to draw them in sand during a conversation
This translates to:
- line based
- two dimensional
- no colouring
- no shading
- no movement
- 
DreamTalk takes the fundamental principles of SandTalk and carefully expands them to span a larger space that while still retaining the essential qualities of the original modality
As such its features consist of:
- line based (SVGs, splines etc.)
- two and three dimensional
- basic colouring
- basic shading
- animations allowed
- 
So a photorealistic image for example would not be considered part of that class, neither would a Van Gogh

# Technical meaning:

Technically, these principles are being worked into a python based programmatic animation library of the same name inspired by 3blue1brown's pioneering work in this space with "manim"
In its current implementation it uses the popular computer graphics software Cinema4D as its backend
